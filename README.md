### 👋 Welcome to my secret palace
Hi! I'm **Shimotsuki Yuzuki** (霜月ゆずき). You may know me from Discord (My Discord account/ Discord bot I made), my YouTube channel, my Instagram, my personal portfolio site... or if you haven't, nice to meet you 😊!

I'm a 19 y/o college undergraduate student from Hong Kong, majoring in electrical engineering? (not really sure for now...) I have been programming a lot since around 2022 (theoretically... much earlier in reality), mostly self-taught and learned from high school subjects.

<br>

## 🚀 About Me

- 🌟 **Who I Am:** A passionate developer and open-source enthusiast. (*Copyright infringement* is not acceptable imo)
- 💻 **What I Do:** Writing code, building projects, and learning something new every day.
- 🎯 **Current Focus:** Building full-stack web applications.
- 🌱 **Currently Learning:** Curl, React, TypeScript, cloud computing...

<br>

My first language was **[Python][Python]**, which is still my main language, but I've used and still use a lot of other languages such as: **JavaScript (JS)**/**[TypeScript (TS)][TypeScript]** (with **HTML** & **CSS**), **[Docker][Docker]**, **SQL** (When I was in high school. Using **[MongoDB][MongoDB]** for now), **C** (For my flipper-zero), and **[R](https://www.r-project.org/)**.

My language of preference depends on the project and how I feel, but generally:
- I use **[Python][Python]** and **[Docker][Docker]** on large projects such as websites
- I use **[Python][Python]** (mainly) or **JS**/**[TS][TypeScript]** on small projects
- I use **[Python][Python]** or **C** for programs that require high-performance
- **JS**/**[TS][TypeScript]**, **HTML**5, **CSS**, and **[MongoDB][MongoDB]** are mostly used in web projects

My favorites are definitely **[Python][Python]** and **[R][R]**; **[Python][Python]** for flexibility and beginner-friendly, and **[R][R]** for awesome graph plotting and analysis.
